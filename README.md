# CoRider Assignment

This repository contains the code for the CoRider Assignment, which is a web application built using Next.js and Chakra UI. The main feature implemented in this assignment is the infinite scrolling for chats to load previous chats.

## Tech Stack

The following technologies and libraries were used in this project:

- **Next.js**: Next.js is a React framework that allows for server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simple API routes.
- **Chakra UI**: Chakra UI is a simple and modular component library for building React applications. It provides a set of accessible and customizable UI components.

## Features

### Infinite Scrolling for Chats

The primary feature of this assignment is the implementation of infinite scrolling for chats. With infinite scrolling, previous chats are loaded dynamically as the user scrolls up, creating a seamless and continuous chat experience. This feature enhances the user experience by reducing the need for manual pagination or clicking on "load more" buttons.
